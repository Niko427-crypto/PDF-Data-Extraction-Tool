 Refer to the corresponding small business size standard

 http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards

 However, the small business size standard for a concern that submits an

 offer but proposes to furnish an end item that it did not itself

 manufacture, process, or produce is 500 employees if the acquisition is

 1) an 8(a), HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned, economically

 disadvantaged women-owned, or women-owned small business set-aside or

 sole-source award; or 2) uses the HUBZone price evaluation preference to

 award to a HUBZone concern, unless the concern waived the evaluation

 preference.

 Fast Pay does not apply to this solicitation



 Due to the volatility of demands, and frequent quantity changes on open

 purchase requests, offerors are highly encouraged to submit quantity

 ranges when quoting. If a PR is evaluated manually, quoting ranges

 provides the buyer the option to combine requirements or reduce the

 administrative burden for either party involved when making an award.

 This does not apply to Auto IDC.



 If you anticipate quoting on a solicitation after the closing date,

 please submit a DIBBS quote with a bid type of “No Bid” and place an

 anticipated quote date or the reason you are not willing to quote. This

 does not prevent you from submitting an actual quote on DIBBS at a later

 date. It will overlay your previous no quote. This informs buyers of

 your intention to quote and prevents multiple calls for updates and

 cancelling of requirements assumed to be non-procurable due to no

 quotes/sources. The submission of an anticipated quote date does not

 preclude DLA from making an award to another acceptable timely offer.
